# Overview

The purpose of this software is to change the measurements in a recipe based on the number of serving you want to make. For example, if a recipe would make enough cookies to feed 4, this softwarre would tell you how much of each ingredient you would need to feed 15.

My personal reason for writing this was to learn the Kotlin language in preparation for android app developement.
